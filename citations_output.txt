Title: SELF-BART : A Transformer-based Molecular Representation Model using SELFIES
Abstract: Large-scale molecular representation methods have revolutionized applications in material science, such as drug discovery, chemical modeling, and material design. With the rise of transformers, models now learn representations directly from molecular structures. In this study, we develop an encoder-decoder model based on BART that is capable of leaning molecular representations and generate new molecules. Trained on SELFIES, a robust molecular string representation, our model outperforms existing baselines in downstream tasks, demonstrating its potential in efficient and effective molecular data analysis and manipulation.

Title: Multimodal Fusion with Relational Learning for Molecular Property Prediction
Abstract: Graph based molecular representation learning is essential for accurately predicting molecular properties in drug discovery and materials science; however, it faces significant challenges due to the intricate relationships among molecules and the limited chemical knowledge utilized during training. While contrastive learning is often employed to handle molecular relationships, its reliance on binary metrics is insufficient for capturing the complexity of these interactions. Multimodal fusion has gained attention for property reasoning, but previous work has explored only a limited range of modalities, and the optimal stages for fusing different modalities in molecular property tasks remain underexplored. In this paper, we introduce MMFRL (Multimodal Fusion with Relational Learning for Molecular Property Prediction), a novel framework designed to overcome these limitations. Our method enhances embedding initialization through multimodal pretraining using relational learning. We also conduct a systematic investigation into the impact of modality fusion at different stages such as early, intermediate, and late, highlighting their advantages and shortcomings. Extensive experiments on MoleculeNet benchmarks demonstrate that MMFRL significantly outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, MMFRL enables task-specific optimizations. Additionally, the explainability of MMFRL provides valuable chemical insights, emphasizing its potential to enhance real-world drug discovery applications.

Title: KA-GNN: Kolmogorov-Arnold Graph Neural Networks for Molecular Property Prediction
Abstract: Molecular property prediction is a crucial task in the process of Artificial Intelligence-Driven Drug Discovery (AIDD). The challenge of developing models that surpass traditional non-neural network methods continues to be a vibrant area of research. This paper presents a novel graph neural network model-the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN)-based Graph Neural Network (KA-GNN), which incorporates Fourier series, specifically designed for molecular property prediction. This model maintains the high interpretability characteristic of KAN methods while being extremely efficient in computational resource usage, making it an ideal choice for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Tested and validated on seven public datasets, KA-GNN has shown significant improvements in property predictions over the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks.

Title: UniGEM: A Unified Approach to Generation and Property Prediction for Molecules
Abstract: Molecular generation and molecular property prediction are both crucial for drug discovery, but they are often developed independently. Inspired by recent studies, which demonstrate that diffusion model, a prominent generative approach, can learn meaningful data representations that enhance predictive tasks, we explore the potential for developing a unified generative model in the molecular domain that effectively addresses both molecular generation and property prediction tasks. However, the integration of these tasks is challenging due to inherent inconsistencies, making simple multi-task learning ineffective. To address this, we propose UniGEM, the first unified model to successfully integrate molecular generation and property prediction, delivering superior performance in both tasks. Our key innovation lies in a novel two-phase generative process, where predictive tasks are activated in the later stages, after the molecular scaffold is formed. We further enhance task balance through innovative training strategies. Rigorous theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments demonstrate our significant improvements in both tasks. The principles behind UniGEM hold promise for broader applications, including natural language processing and computer vision.

Title: Improving Predictive Efficacy for Drug Resistance in Novel HIV-1 Protease Inhibitors through Transfer Learning Mechanisms.
Abstract: The human immunodeficiency virus presents a significant global health challenge due to its rapid mutation and the development of resistance mechanisms against antiretroviral drugs. Recent studies demonstrate the impressive performance of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models in predicting the drug resistance profile of specific FDA-approved inhibitors. However, generalizing ML and DL models to learn not only from isolates but also from inhibitor representations remains challenging for HIV-1 infection. We propose a novel drug-isolate-fold change (DIF) model framework that aims to predict drug resistance score directly from the protein sequence and inhibitor representation. Various ML and DL models, inhibitor representations, and protein representations were analyzed through realistic validation mechanisms. To enhance the molecular learning capacity of DIF models, we employ a transfer learning approach by pretraining a graph neural network (GNN) model for activity prediction on a data set of 4855 HIV-1 protease inhibitors (PIs). By performing various realistic validation strategies on internal and external genotype-phenotype data sets, we statistically show that the learned representations of inhibitors improve the predictive ability of DIF-based ML and DL models. We achieved an accuracy of 0.802, AUROC of 0.874, and r of 0.727 for the unseen external PIs. By comparing the DIF-based models with a null model consisting of isolate-fold change (IF) architecture, it is observed that the DIF models significantly benefit from molecular representations. Combined results from various testing strategies and statistical tests confirm the effectiveness of DIF models in testing novel PIs for drug resistance in the presence of an isolate.

Title: Predicting Drug Effects from High-Dimensional, Asymmetric Drug Datasets by Using Graph Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Analysis of Multitarget Drug Effect Prediction
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as one of the most effective ML techniques for drug effect prediction from drug molecular graphs. Despite having immense potential, GNN models lack performance when using datasets that contain high-dimensional, asymmetrically co-occurrent drug effects as targets with complex correlations between them. Training individual learning models for each drug effect and incorporating every prediction result for a wide spectrum of drug effects are impractical. Therefore, an opportunity exists to address this challenge as multitarget prediction problems and predict all drug effects at a time. We developed standard and hybrid GNNs to perform two separate tasks: multiregression for continuous values and multilabel classification for categorical values contained in our datasets. Because multilabel classification makes the target data even more sparse and introduces asymmetric label co-occurrence, learning these models becomes difficult and heavily impacts the GNN's performance. To address these challenges, we propose a new data oversampling technique to improve multilabel classification performances on all the given imbalanced molecular graph datasets. Using the technique, we improve the data imbalance ratio of the drug effects while protecting the datasets' integrity. Finally, we evaluate the multilabel classification performance of the best-performing hybrid GNN model on all the oversampled datasets obtained from the proposed oversampling technique. In all the evaluation metrics (i.e., precision, recall, and F1 score), this model significantly outperforms other ML models, including GNN models when they are trained on the original datasets or oversampled datasets with MLSMOTE, which is a well-known oversampling technique.

Title: Molecular topological deep learning for polymer property prediction
Abstract: Accurate and efficient prediction of polymer properties is of key importance for polymer design. Traditional experimental tools and density function theory (DFT)-based simulations for polymer property evaluation, are both expensive and time-consuming. Recently, a gigantic amount of graph-based molecular models have emerged and demonstrated huge potential in molecular data analysis. Even with the great progresses, these models tend to ignore the high-order and mutliscale information within the data. In this paper, we develop molecular topological deep learning (Mol-TDL) for polymer property analysis. Our Mol-TDL incorporates both high-order interactions and multiscale properties into topological deep learning architecture. The key idea is to represent polymer molecules as a series of simplicial complices at different scales and build up simplical neural networks accordingly. The aggregated information from different scales provides a more accurate prediction of polymer molecular properties.

Title: Geometric Representation Condition Improves Equivariant Molecule Generation
Abstract: Recent advancements in molecular generative models have demonstrated substantial potential in accelerating scientific discovery, particularly in drug design. However, these models often face challenges in generating high-quality molecules, especially in conditional scenarios where specific molecular properties must be satisfied. In this work, we introduce GeoRCG, a general framework to enhance the performance of molecular generative models by integrating geometric representation conditions. We decompose the molecule generation process into two stages: first, generating an informative geometric representation; second, generating a molecule conditioned on the representation. Compared to directly generating a molecule, the relatively easy-to-generate representation in the first-stage guides the second-stage generation to reach a high-quality molecule in a more goal-oriented and much faster way. Leveraging EDM as the base generator, we observe significant quality improvements in unconditional molecule generation on the widely-used QM9 and GEOM-DRUG datasets. More notably, in the challenging conditional molecular generation task, our framework achieves an average 31\% performance improvement over state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting the superiority of conditioning on semantically rich geometric representations over conditioning on individual property values as in previous approaches. Furthermore, we show that, with such representation guidance, the number of diffusion steps can be reduced to as small as 100 while maintaining superior generation quality than that achieved with 1,000 steps, thereby significantly accelerating the generation process.

Title: FARM: Functional Group-Aware Representations for Small Molecules
Abstract: We introduce Functional Group-Aware Representations for Small Molecules (FARM), a novel foundation model designed to bridge the gap between SMILES, natural language, and molecular graphs. The key innovation of FARM lies in its functional group-aware tokenization, which directly incorporates functional group information into the representations. This strategic reduction in tokenization granularity is intentionally aligned with key drivers of functional properties (i.e., functional groups), enhancing the model's understanding of chemical language. By expanding the chemical lexicon, FARM more effectively bridges SMILES and natural language, ultimately advancing the model's capacity to predict molecular properties. FARM also represents molecules from two perspectives: by using masked language modeling to capture atom-level features and by employing graph neural networks to encode the whole molecule topology. By leveraging contrastive learning, FARM aligns these two views of representations into a unified molecular embedding. We rigorously evaluate FARM on the MoleculeNet dataset, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance on 10 out of 12 tasks. These results highlight FARM's potential to improve molecular representation learning, with promising applications in drug discovery and pharmaceutical research.
